I am a novice programmer trying to simultaneously learn c, game development, procedural sound design, and git/ collaborative development.

Eventually, I want to bring this project up to a high coding standard, as I learn what that means.

This project will be a basic raycasting-style game with mostly procedurally generated content.

So far (planned), it will depend on/ use SDL and libpd.

The parts I write myself will be licensed according to the GPLv2
